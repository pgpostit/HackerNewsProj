# Hacker News Proj
This is a web scraping project that shows you latest Hacker News stories (and their links) in your terminal. The program was made on Zero to Mastery Python course and upgraded by me to have a customizable filter. Run on your Developer Enviroment, or in your terminal enter: 'python3 main.py'

## Installation
This program requires python3 installed. On python3 terminal, run: 'python install -r requirements.txt'
